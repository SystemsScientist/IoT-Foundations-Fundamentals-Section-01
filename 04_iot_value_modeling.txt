Value Modeling

	- 3-step process for creating value in IoT products

Value Proposition

	- Dry clothes as quickly, or for as little money as possible,
	  while maintaining clothing integrity

Quantify Value Proposition

	- Ventilation
	
	- Heat
	
	- time/energy = f(ventilation, heat, energy price)

Expanded Cybermodel

	- time/energy = f(fan speed, angular velocity, load weight
					  heater temp, drum temp, energy price)	
					  
	- variables expose sensors needed in a dryer
	
	- minimize time = f(max fan speed, angular velocity, load weight,
						max heater temp, max drum temp, energy price)

Analytics

	- Looking at the Past
	
		+ Report on something that happened
		
	- Looking at the Present
	
		+ Monitor something that's happening
	
	- Looking at the Future
	
		+ Determining an outcome from current values

Value modeling is key and a differentiator between the smart, connected,
and IoT components.
